# Algs Workspace

This repository contains assignment solutions for Coursera *[Algorithms part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1?)* course

## Why taking this course

I am already taking the DSA course [CS61B](https://github.com/HsHs-dev/UCB-CS61B), but after begining the second part (the content after Project1) of the course, I felt I need a complementary course that gives a hands on, more implementations approach to Data structures, which I have found in this one.

This course is considered one of top algorithms courses on *Coursera*. and Prof.Sedgewick has the ability to expalin complex algorithms in an easy way.
